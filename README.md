Matthes, E. (2023). Python crash course: A hands-on, project-based introduction to programming (3rd ed.). No Starch Press.
I used and modified the code for my hangman game with
Python for Beginners. (n.d.). Python game hangman. Python for Beginners. Retrieved February 27, 2025, from https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/code-snippets-source-code/game-hangman
